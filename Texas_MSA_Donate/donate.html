                <h1>Become a Legacy Longhorn Today!</h1>
                <p>
                    Every year, about 1,000 students come to the Texas MSA to find a community that will help foster their love for Islam and connect them to other Muslims on campus. Be a part of this legacy by giving as little as a dollar a day ($30 a month) that will go towards hosting impactful events such as Deen Intensive, Cookie Halaqas, Dawah workshops, New Student Orientation, Welcome & Farewell Dinners, Muslims Around the World, Sisters & Brothers Qiyams and much more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your generosity not only helps sustain these vital programs but also ensures that every student feels supported and connected through their journey at Texas MSA. Join us in shaping the future of our community by becoming a Legacy Longhorn now, and witness the transformative power of your contribution firsthand!
