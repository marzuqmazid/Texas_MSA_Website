							<h1 style="text-align: center;">Our Mission</h1>
							<p style="text-align: center;">Established in 1967, the Muslim Students’ Association at UT strives to serve Allah (God) in the best way possible through the principles laid out in the Honorable Quran and Sunnah. We seek to achieve this goal by promoting unity, providing education, and giving back to the local community through a wide array of activities held each year. MSA also seeks to uphold the values of tolerance, compassion, and sincerity in hopes of raising awareness and building understanding among different campus communities. Events such as Welcome Dinner, Friendsgiving, Fastathon and Charity Week have formed the core of a strong tradition of outreach that we wish to build upon and continue in the years to come. Membership is open to all UT students and faculty.</p>
